      "are:\n",
      "\n",

      "The Transformer employs multi-head attention in three different ways:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer, and the memory keys and values come from the output of the\n",
      "encoder. This allows every position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence.\n",
      "2. The encoder contains self-attention layers, where each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the encoder.\n",
      "3. Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to all positions in the decoder up to and including\n",

      "Multi-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions, which cannot be\n",

      "Q4: How does the Transformer handle sequence order?\n",
      " response:   Sure! I'll do my best to provide a helpful and respectful response.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Transformer handles sequence order through the use of self-attention mechanisms. In the encoder, self-attention layers allow each position to\n",
      "attend to all positions in the previous layer of the encoder. Similarly, in the decoder, self-attention layers allow each position to attend to all\n",

      " response:   Attention in Transformers is a mechanism that allows the model to selectively focus on certain\n",
