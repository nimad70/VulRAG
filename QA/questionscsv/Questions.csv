Question ID,Question,Answer
PHY1,What is Newton's first law of motion?,Newton's first law of motion states that an object will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force.
PHY2,How does the force of gravity between two objects change with distance?,"The force of gravity between two objects decreases as the square of the distance between them increases. This is expressed by the formula F = G * (m1 * m2) / r^2, where F is the gravitational force, G is the gravitational constant, m1 and m2 are the masses of the objects, and r is the distance between the centers of the two masses."
PHY3,What is the principle of conservation of energy?,"The principle of conservation of energy states that the total energy in an isolated system remains constant over time. Energy can be transformed from one form to another, but it cannot be created or destroyed."
PHY4,Explain how a prism splits white light into a spectrum of colors.,"A prism splits white light into a spectrum of colors due to refraction. Different colors (wavelengths) of light are bent by different amounts as they pass through the prism, separating them into a spectrum."
PHY5,What is quantum physics?,"Quantum physics is a branch of physics that studies the behavior of matter and energy at the smallest scales, such as atoms and subatomic particles. It describes how these particles interact and the fundamental properties they exhibit at this level, which often differ significantly from classical physics predictions."
NNW1,What is a neural network?,A neural network is a series of algorithms that attempt to recognize underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics the way the human brain operates.
NNW2,What function do activation functions serve in neural networks?,"Activation functions in neural networks help to introduce non-linearities into the model, allowing it to learn more complex patterns. They decide whether a neuron should be activated or not."
NNW3,What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning in machine learning?,"In supervised learning, the model learns from a labeled dataset, providing answers as it trains on data that includes both the inputs and the outputs. Unsupervised learning involves training a model on data that does not include labels, allowing the model to act on that information without guidance."
NNW4,Can you explain what overfitting means in the context of training a neural network?,"Overfitting occurs when a neural network model learns the detail and noise in the training data to the extent that it negatively impacts the performance of the model on new data (i.e., it performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data)."
NNW5,What is the significance of the learning rate in training neural networks?,The learning rate in training neural networks is a hyperparameter that controls how much to change the model in response to the estimated error each time the model weights are updated. Itâ€™s crucial for achieving convergence in training but setting it too high or too low can lead to poor results.
