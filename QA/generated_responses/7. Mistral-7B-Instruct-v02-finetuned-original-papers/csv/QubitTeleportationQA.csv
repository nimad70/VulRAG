" The main components used in quantum networks for
teleportation include solid-state spin qubits, entanglement swapping on the middle node, and storage in a memory qubit. Additionally, there are
innovations such as improved qubit readout procedures, active memory qubit protection during entanglement generation, and tailored heralding to reduce
remote entanglement infidelities."," Entanglement is established between distant nodes in a
quantum network through an entanglement swapping protocol mediated by a third node, such as a quantum repeater protocol. This process creates a shared
entangled state between the distant nodes, allowing for reliable quantum information transfer."," The Bell-state measurement (BSM) plays a crucial role
in quantum teleportation. It allows for the transfer of quantum information from one node to another through a pre-shared entangled state. By
performing a joint BSM on the sender's part of the entangled state and the qubit state to be teleported, the state is recovered on the receiving node
by a gate operation conditioned on the BSM outcome. This process is insensitive to loss in the connecting photonic channels and on intermediate nodes,
making it ideal for reliable quantum communication across long distances."," Quantum
teleportation is considered advantageous over traditional communication methods in quantum networks because it allows for the reliable transfer of
quantum information across lossy network links without being affected by loss in the connecting photonic channels and on intermediate nodes. This
makes it insensitive to loss and enables unconditional teleportation, where state transfer is achieved each time a qubit is sent through the network.
Additionally, quantum teleportation is a key primitive of quantum network protocols and applications."," Innovations introduced in this work include
improvements in memory qubit readout and protection during entanglement generation, as well as real-time rejection of false heralding signals. These
methods will be instrumental in exploring more complex protocols and can be readily transferred to other platforms. Additionally, the successful
preparation of the teleporter is heralded, the input qubit state is prepared on Charlie and finally teleported to Alice. Entanglement fidelity of the
network links is also crucial for quantum teleportation."," The main challenges associated
with extending quantum teleportation beyond directly connected nodes include the demanding requirements on the pre-shared remote entanglement, joint
qubit readout, and coherence times. These issues have hindered progress in realizing quantum teleportation between non-neighboring nodes. However,
recent advances in memory qubit readout and protection during entanglement generation, as well as real-time rejection of false heralding signals, have
made it possible to achieve unconditional qubit teleportation between non-neighboring nodes in a quantum network. This work represents a significant
step forward in the development of future quantum networks and opens the door to exploring teleportation-based multi-node protocols and applications."," Memory qubits play a crucial role in the
process of quantum teleportation in a network. They serve as a reliable medium for storing the entangled state generated during the teleportation
protocol. This allows for the efficient transfer of quantum information between distant nodes without the need for direct physical contact.
Additionally, memory qubits enable the extension of the memory preservation time through active coherence protection from the spin bath. Overall,
memory qubits are essential components of a quantum network, enabling the implementation of advanced teleportation protocols and paving the way for
future quantum technologies."," Potential future applications of quantum
teleportation in quantum networks include executing and testing multi-node protocols and applications through platform-independent control software,
which is an important prerequisite for a large-scale future network. Additionally, improvements in phase stabilization and extending current schemes
for use in deployed fiber are expected to yield higher fidelity in teleportation."," Real-time feed-forward plays a crucial role in achieving
unconditional quantum teleportation by enabling state transfer each time a qubit state is inserted into the teleporter. The presence of feed-forward
operations significantly improves the average state fidelity compared to the case where no feed-forward is applied. However, it also introduces
additional error sources such as depolarizing noise on Alice during the decoupling sequence and ionization probability on Alice. These error sources
must be carefully considered and mitigated to ensure successful teleportation."," To achieve
efficient quantum teleportation between non-neighbouring nodes, several technical advancements are required. These include improvements in the
fidelity of entanglement generation, the development of robust qubit readout procedures, and the implementation of active memory qubit protection
during entanglement generation. Additionally, tailored heralding schemes can reduce remote entanglement infidelities and enable unconditional
teleportation. These innovations will be crucial for exploring more complex protocols and applications in future quantum networks."
