" Newton's first law of motion, also known as the law of inertia, states that every body stays at
rest or moves at a constant velocity unless acted upon by a net external force. It is a fundamental principle of classical mechanics."," The force of gravity between two objects decreases with
increasing distance due to the inverse square law of gravity. This means that the force of gravity between two objects is proportional to the product
of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them."," The principle of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or
destroyed, but can only be transferred from one form to another. It is a fundamental concept in physics and plays a crucial role in understanding the
behavior of physical systems. In the context of cosmology, the conservation of energy is written in terms of the Friedmann equation and the energy-
conservation equation, which give the evolution equation for the scale factor of the universe."," Prisms split white light into a spectrum of colors due to
refraction. White light is made up of different wavelengths, each of which bends differently when it passes through a prism. This causes the
separation of the different wavelengths, resulting in a rainbow-like spectrum."," Quantum physics is a branch of physics that deals with the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and
subatomic level. It is based on the principles of quantum mechanics, which describes the properties of particles and their interactions with each
other. Some key concepts in quantum physics include wave-particle duality, uncertainty principle, entanglement, and non-local correlations. These
ideas have led to numerous technological developments, such as quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum sensing. However, there are still
many fundamental questions about the nature of quantum reality that remain unsolved."," A neural network is a type of machine learning model that is designed to recognize patterns. It consists of
interconnected nodes called neurons, which process and transmit information. Neural networks are trained on labeled data to learn how to classify new
examples. They have applications in various fields, including image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing."," Activation functions serve several purposes in neural networks. They
introduce nonlinearity, allowing the network to learn complex patterns. They also control the flow of information within the network, influencing how
signals propagate through time and interact along different dimensions. Additionally, they can affect the stability and convergence properties of the
network during training. Popular choices include sigmoid, rectified linear unit (ReLU), leaky ReLU, and their variants."," Supervised learning involves training a
model on labeled data, while unsupervised learning involves finding patterns or relationships in unlabeled data. Supervised learning requires explicit
labels, while unsupervised learning relies on implicit features. Supervised learning algorithms include regression, classification, and neural
networks, while unsupervised learning algorithms include clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection. Supervised learning is often
used for predictive tasks, such as image recognition and speech synthesis, while unsupervised learning is commonly used for exploratory tasks, like
feature extraction and anomaly detection."," Overfitting refers to a situation where a neural
network learns the noise in the training data rather than the underlying pattern, leading to poor performance on new data. This can be prevented by
techniques such as dropout and regularization."," The learning rate is a crucial parameter in training
neural networks. It determines how quickly the network converges to the optimal solution. A high learning rate can lead to faster convergence but may
result in overshooting the minimum, while a low learning rate can take longer to find the minimum but may provide better accuracy. Finding the optimal
learning rate involves a tradeoff between speed and accuracy. In practice, a learning rate schedule is often employed, where the learning rate is
gradually reduced over time to allow the network to fine-tune its parameters."
