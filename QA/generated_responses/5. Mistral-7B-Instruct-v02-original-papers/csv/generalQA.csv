" Newton's First Law of Motion, also known as the Law of Inertia, states that an object will
remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by a net external force."," The force of gravity between two objects decreases with
increasing distance, following an inverse square law. This means that the force is proportional to the product of the masses of the two objects and
inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them."," The principle of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or
destroyed in an isolated system. It is a fundamental law of physics that applies to all forms of energy, including potential energy, kinetic energy,
thermal energy, electrical energy, and radiation energy. This principle is a direct consequence of the general covariance of the theory of relativity."," A prism separates white light into its component colors based on
the refractive index of each wavelength. As light enters the prism, it slows down and bends at different angles depending on its wavelength. Shorter
wavelengths (blue and violet light) bend more than longer wavelengths (red and orange light), causing them to spread out further when exiting the
prism, resulting in a rainbow-like spectrum."," Quantum physics is a branch of physics that describes natural phenomena at the subatomic level using the
principles of quantum mechanics. It is one of the most accurate theories ever developed to describe our universe and has led to numerous technological
advancements, including superfast quantum computers, unbreakable quantum cryptography, and ultrasensitive quantum sensors. Despite significant
progress in understanding quantum mechanics, there are still fundamental questions about its foundations that remain open."," A neural network is a type of machine learning model inspired by the human brain, consisting of
interconnected nodes or neurons that process and transmit information using activations functions."," Activation functions introduce non-linearity in neural networks,
allowing them to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs beyond simple linear combinations. They introduce non-linearity by applying a
non-linear function to the weighted sum of inputs. Examples include ReLU, sigmoid, tanh, and Swish functions."," Supervised learning involves training a
model on labeled data, meaning the input features come with corresponding output labels. The goal is for the model to learn the mapping between inputs
and outputs. Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, deals with unlabeled data, where there are no output labels provided. Instead, the objective is
to find patterns or relationships within the data itself without any explicit guidance."," Overfitting refers to a neural network that
learns the training data too well, including the noise and irrelevant details, to the point that it performs poorly on new, unseen data. This results
in poor generalization ability and reduced accuracy on test data. Overfitting can be prevented through techniques such as dropout, early stopping, and
regularization."," The learning rate is a crucial hyperparameter in training
neural networks that determines the size of the step taken during the optimization process. A larger learning rate leads to faster convergence but may
result in overshooting the optimal solution, while a smaller learning rate ensures slower convergence but provides more accurate updates. Finding the
right learning rate can significantly impact the performance of the model. In the given context, the authors performed learning rate sweeps to
determine the best learning rates for their models and used a cosine decay schedule with a long warmup period."
