" Every body stays at rest or at uniform rectilinear motion unless there are forces acting upon
it."," The force of gravity between two objects decreases with
increasing distance due to the inverse square law of attraction. This means that the force of gravity between two objects is proportional to the
product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. For example, if the mass of one object is doubled while
keeping the distance between the two objects constant, then the force of gravity between them will also double. Similarly, if the distance between the
two objects is increased by a factor of four while keeping their masses constant, then the force of gravity between them will decrease by a factor of
sixteen. Overall, the force of gravity between two objects depends on both their masses and the distance separating them."," The principle of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or
destroyed, but can only be transferred or transformed from one form to another. It is a fundamental law of physics that applies to all physical
systems, including the universe as a whole. The conservation of energy is a direct consequence of the general covariance of Einstein's theory of
relativity."," Prisms work by refracting light, which causes different wavelengths
to bend at different angles. This results in the separation of white light into its component colors. The angle of refraction depends on the
wavelength of the light, so shorter wavelengths bend more than longer ones. As a result, the light exiting the prism is separated into a spectrum of
colors, with each color corresponding to a specific wavelength."," Quantum physics is a branch of physics that describes the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and
subatomic level. It is based on the principles of quantum mechanics, which include wave-particle duality, uncertainty principle, and superposition.
These principles have led to the development of various quantum technologies, such as quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum
teleportation. However, there are still many unanswered questions about the interpretation of quantum mechanics and its implications for the
fundamental structure of the universe."," A neural network is a type of artificial intelligence system designed to recognize patterns and make
decisions based on data inputs. It consists of interconnected nodes called neurons, which process information through a series of mathematical
functions. These networks can be trained to perform specific tasks, such as image recognition or speech synthesis, by adjusting the weights of the
connections between neurons."," Activation functions serve several purposes in neural networks. They
introduce nonlinearity, allowing the network to learn complex relationships between inputs and outputs. Additionally, they help regulate the dynamics
of backpropagation during training, preventing vanishing gradients and ensuring stable convergence. Popular choices for activation functions include
sigmoid, rectified linear unit (ReLU), leaky ReLU, and exponential linear units (ELUs)."," Supervised learning involves training a
model on labeled data, while unsupervised learning involves training a model on unlabeled data. The goal of supervised learning is to predict labels
for new data, while the goal of unsupervised learning is to discover hidden patterns or structures in the data."," Overfitting refers to a situation where a neural
network learns the noise in the training data rather than the underlying pattern, leading to poor performance on new, unseen data. This can occur when
the model has too many parameters relative to the amount of available training data, causing it to memorize the training examples instead of
generalizing well. Regularization techniques such as dropout and weight decay can help mitigate overfitting by adding randomness during training and
reducing the magnitude of the weights, respectively."," The learning rate plays an important role in the
convergence of neural networks. A high learning rate can cause oscillatory behavior and instability, while a low learning rate may lead to slow
convergence. Finding the optimal learning rate is crucial for achieving good performance in deep learning models.

In this study, the authors employed a cosine learning rate schedule, which increases the learning rate linearly for the first warmup\_steps training
steps and then decays it proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. This strategy helps balance the tradeoff between exploration
and exploitation during training.

The choice of learning rate depends on various factors, including the size of the dataset, the complexity of the model, and the optimization algorithm
used. In general, smaller datasets require higher learning rates to achieve satisfactory performance, while larger datasets allow for lower learning
rates due to the abundance of training data. Additionally, more complex models often require lower learning rates to converge effectively.

It is worth noting that the optimal learning rate is not always known beforehand and may need to be adjusted during training. Techniques like adaptive
learning rate methods can be useful in finding the optimal learning rate for a particular problem."
